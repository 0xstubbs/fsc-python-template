# python-template
 A conda based template for easy setup of reproducible repos integrating Flipside data & Python for data science.

 The template has been slightly modified for using the GitHub CLI and a terminal to clone the repo, edit files, and initiate the repo.

# Initializing the Repo 

~10 min video review of the process using Github Desktop and GUIs available here: [Python Template For Reproducible Data Science](https://www.loom.com/share/Using-the-Python-Template-for-Reproducible-Data-Science-2c524ce317394dc7884cc8927b524910)

1. clone the [Stubbs Python Template](https://github.com/0xstubbs/fsc-python-template.git) and give it your desired name.

``` git clone https://github.com/0xstubbs/fsc-python-template.git python-template```

2. delete the (possibly hidden) .git folder to remove the commit history.

```rm -r .git```

3. Create a git repo for the folder using Github CLI(you will need to use a flag for --public or --private).

```gh repo create fsc-python-template --public```

4. If the repo is created successfully it will give you the URL needed to create the remote repository, for example;

```✓ Created repository 0xstubbs/fsc-python-template on GitHub```

5. Initiate the git repository

```git init```

6. Add the remote repository to your GitHub account so you can push/pull.

```git remote add origin https://github.com/0xstubbs/fsc-python-template.git```

7. Do your initial commit and push to the server.

```
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git push -u origin master
```

You now have a new git repository ready to go. Be sure to update the README.md for your repo.

## Configure Your Setup

1. Create a .env file with your api key.
```echo "FLIPSIDE_API_KEY=\"<insert key>\"" >> .env```
2. Remove system dependencies from environment.yml file.
3. Create your conda environment from environment.yml file.
```conda env create -f environment.yml fsc-python-template```
4. Activate your conda environment
```conda activate fsc-python-template```
5. If you if you install new packages be sure to add them to your environment.yml file.
```conda env export > environment.yml```

# Reproduce 

1. Clone this repo. I use GitHub Desktop, you can grab the URL to clone in that app, or use `git clone https://github.com/fsc-data-science/python-template.git`
2. Create a txt file called `.env` and place your API key (you can create one via the API page when logged into Flipside: https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/account/api-keys )
3. Open miniconda3  and move to your cloned directory `cd YourLocationHere/python-template`
4. In Conda create a new environment using the provided environment.yml file: `conda env create -f environment.yml` and optionally rename with `--name new_conda_name`

The environment yml includes installs for flipside, numpy, pandas, and plotly, alongside this python-template environment name and python 3.10.9

5. Activate the new environment: `conda activate python-template` 
6. Run the analysis script `hello-flipside.py` using your `python-template` Kernel. If you create an interactive HTML file (`candlestick_chart.html`) it worked! (Open in browser to see the eth volume weighted average price candle chart over the last 30 days).
7. You can restart your git history, rename the directory, and/or clone & replace the conda with `conda create --name new_environment_name --clone python-template` 

8. As you work with your own repos and environments, use `conda env export > environment.yml` to manage new package installations and ensure reproducibility for those who clone your repos!

# Flipside API 

You can generate API keys to bring SQL queries from the data studio into Python 
via the flipside package. This repo includes it in the environment for you. Note: API Keys are capped at a free 5,000 query seconds/month.
 So it is recommended you write your queries in the (free) Studio first, and then bring the polished query into Python once it runs as expected.

Relatedly, keep our docs handy as you work with data from Flipside. 

https://docs.flipsidecrypto.com/flipside-api/get-started/run-your-first-query

For simplicity you may want to keep this auto-paginate function handy until it is formally added to the package. You can convert the result to a pandas data frame using `pd.DataFrame()`

```
"""This function will be added to Flipside package after testing, just copy/paste as needed for now"""
def auto_paginate_result(query_result_set, page_size=10000):
    """
    This function auto-paginates a query result to get all the data. It assumes 10,000 rows per page.
    In case of an error, reduce the page size. Uses numpy.
    """
    num_rows = query_result_set.page.totalRows
    page_count = np.ceil(num_rows / page_size).astype(int)
    all_rows = []
    current_page = 1
    while current_page <= page_count:
        results = flipside.get_query_results(
            query_result_set.query_id,
            page_number=current_page,
            page_size=page_size
        )

        if results.records:
            all_rows.extend(results.records)  # Use extend() to add list elements

        current_page += 1  # Increment the current page number

    return all_rows  # Return all_rows in JSON format
```
